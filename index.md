# Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide a repeatable framework, or playbook, for prospecting our territory. The playbook contains various tactics to gain entry into target accounts including sample email messages, phone and voicemail scripts, social examples, and a recommended outreach cadence. In addition, the playbook places strong emphasis on tracking our activities so we can make adjustments based on data, rather than emotions. 

# Outbound Strategy

Our outbound strategy will consist of multiple touches via email, telephone, and social spread across a 10-Touch Cadence. The
cadence is important to follow because it provides a methodology for consistently interacting with prospects and gives us a way to measure our success. 

## 10-Touch Outbound Cadence
 
 Day | Tactic
 -------------| -------------
 Day 1 | Email 1, Phone 1
 Day 3 | VM 1, Social 1
 Day 5 | Phone 2, Social 2
 Day 7 | Phone 3, VM 2, Email 2
 Day 10| Phone 4
 
The goal is to add each prospect to a 10-Day Cadence until we get a yes or no.  Each Cadence will have a theme related to a common problem or challenge a prospect is experiencing for their specific role. Each outreach will be tied to the specific business problem. 

If, after the 10 day period we’re unable to schedule an intro call, we’ll hold off for 2-weeks before adding them to a different themed Cadence.

# Time Management Strategies

## Prioritizing Your Outreach

In order to be as effective as possible, we need to pay close attention to how we spend our time. One suggestion is to prioritize activities based on the temperature of the prospect as it relates to their interactions with the brand.  As an example, a prospect who has registered for a webinar should take priority over a prospect who has never heard of us. Below is a list of “demand signals” that we can use to prioritize our outreach: 
* HubSpot activities such as website visits, content downloads, etc.
* Email engagement activities tracked by Yesware or SalesLoft.
* Social views or follows on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
* Webinar registrants and attendees.
* Tradeshow attendees and speakers.

## Tips for Maximizing Efficiency

Here are a few tips for maximizing your efficiency: 
* Create your call list the night before.
* Chunk your schedule into similar activities and only do that one thing. For example, if you're making calls for the next hour don't do anything else. Turn off email, social, etc. This is a time killer!
* Do your research before you make your calls, not during. 
* Track your activities on paper, or in a spreadsheet, and add your notes to Salesforce at the end of the day.
* Pre-record your voicemails in SalesLoft
