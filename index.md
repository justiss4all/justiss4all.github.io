# Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide a repeatable framework, or playbook, for prospecting our territory. The playbook contains various tactics to gain entry into target accounts including sample email messages, phone and voicemail scripts, social examples, and a recommended outreach cadence. In addition, the playbook places strong emphasis on tracking our activities so we can make adjustments based on data, rather than emotions. 

# Outbound Strategy

Our outbound strategy will consist of multiple touches via email, telephone, and social spread across a 10-Touch Cadence. The
cadence is important to follow because it provides a methodology for consistently interacting with prospects and gives us a way to measure our success. 

## 10-Touch Outbound Cadence
 
 Day | Tactic
 -------------| -------------
 Day 1 | Email 1, Phone 1
 Day 3 | VM 1, Social 1
 Day 5 | Phone 2, Social 2
 Day 7 | Phone 3, VM 2, Email 2
 Day 10| Phone 4
 
The goal is to add each prospect to a 10-Day Cadence until we get a yes or no.  Each Cadence will have a theme related to a common problem or challenge a prospect is experiencing for their specific role. Each touchpoint's copy will be tied to the over-arching theme. 

If we’re unable to schedule an intro call after the 10 day period we’ll hold off for 2-weeks before adding them to a different themed cadence. 

# Cadence Themes
The idea behind a theme is to focus on a potential problem or challenge a prospect may be grappling with over the course of a cadence. This way, you build familiarity with each impression. Each theme will be relevant to a specific persona. Below is a list of themes broken out by persona with example copy.

# Activity Metrics
There are a number of activity metrics and ratios we'll be using to monitor the success of our efforts. We'll measure performance on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. In order for us to be successful it's critical that we log the appropriate activities in Salesforce. 

### Number of Dials
The number of outbound dials to a prospective customer including voicemail.

### Number of Connects
The number of times you speak with a human over the telephone regardless of outcome. 

### Number of Meaningful Conversations (MCs)
The total number of meaningful conversations you have with prospects during a given time period. This includes an agreement to a discovery call or gathering G2 on the account such as current relationships or initiatives. While our main goal is to schedule a follow-up call, collecting information about an account is just as valuable. MCs do not include hang-ups or "not interested".

### Number of Emails
The number of emails sent to prospective customers. 

### Number of Social Impressions
The number of social impressions made on a prospective customers.

### Dial:Connect Ratio
A ratio calculated using Number of Dials:Number of Connects. This helps us understand how clean our phone number list is and how frequently people engage over the telephone.

### Total Touch:Discovery Ratio
A ratio calculated by adding dials, emails, and social and comparing it to the number of discovery calls. The purpose of this KPI is to help us understand how much effort is required to schedule a discovery call. We should plan on 20 - 25 total touches per cold prospect. 

### Total Touch:SQL Ratio
A ratio calculated by adding dials, emails, and social and comparing it to the number of Sales Qualified Leads.

# Time Management Strategies

## Prioritizing Your Outreach

In order to be as effective as possible, we need to pay close attention to how we spend our time. One suggestion is to prioritize activities based on the temperature of the prospect as it relates to their interactions with the brand.  As an example, a prospect who has registered for a webinar should take priority over a prospect who has never heard of us. Below is a list of “demand signals” that we can use to prioritize our outreach: 
* HubSpot activities such as website visits, content downloads, etc.
* Email engagement activities tracked by Yesware or SalesLoft.
* Social views or follows on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
* Webinar registrants and attendees.
* Tradeshow attendees and speakers.
* Events on our Marketing calendar such as webinars and content. 

## Tips for Maximizing Efficiency

Here are a few tips for maximizing your efficiency: 
* Create your call list the night before.
* Chunk your schedule into similar activities and only do that one thing. For example, if you're making calls for the next hour don't do anything else. Turn off email, social, etc. This is a time killer!
* Do your research before you make your calls, not during. 
* Track your activities on paper, or in a spreadsheet, and add your notes to Salesforce at the end of the day.
* Pre-record your voicemails in SalesLoft
