# Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide a repeatable framework, or playbook, for prospecting our territory. The playbook contains various tactics to gain entry into our target accounts including sample email messages, phone and voicemail scripts, social interactions, and a recommended outreach cadence. In addition, the playbook places strong emphasis on tracking our activities so we can make adjustments based on data, rather than emotions. 

## Prioritizing Your Day

In order to be as effective as possible, we need to pay close attention to how we spend our time. One suggestion is to prioritize activities based on the temperature of the prospect as it relates to their interactions with the brand.  As an example, a prospect who has registered for a webinar should take priority over a prospect who has never heard of us. Below is a list of “demand signals” that we can use to prioritize our outreach: 
* HubSpot activities such as website visits, content downloads, etc.
* Email engagement activities tracked by Yesware or SalesLoft.
* Social views or follows on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
* Webinar registrants and attendees.
* Tradeshow attendees and speakers.
